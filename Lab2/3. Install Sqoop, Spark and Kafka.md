# Install Sqoop, Spark and Kafka
Installing Kafka requires some special attention. You will need to download, distribute and activate the Kafka package before you can add the Kafka service.
## 1. Create user “training” with password “training” and add to group wheel for sudo access.
```
$ sudo adduser training
$ sudo passwd training
$ sudo usermod -aG wheel training
```

## 2. Log into Hue as user “training” with password “training”
화면캡처

### - This will create a HDFS directory for the user
```
$ hdfs dfs -mkdir /user/training
```

## 3. Now, try ssh’ing into the hosts as user “training”
```
$ su - training1
$ ssh nn
The authenticity of host 'dn1 (172.31.5.235)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:mfjrweReiLK1Uv2HzjSgiH9OOsAWX8FBLU88yi9X8sI.
ECDSA key fingerprint is MD5:25:95:19:b5:c1:06:47:a0:79:6b:be:14:46:b9:e4:5d.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Warning: Permanently added 'dn1,172.31.5.235' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
training1@dn1's password:
$ exit
$ ssh dn1
$ exit
$ ssh dn2
$ exit
$ ssh dn3
$ exit
```

## 4. From the bit.ly folder, download all.zip and unzip it.
### - Do this in both your CM host and one of the datanode hosts.
### - Go to training_material/devsh/scripts and review the setup.sh
Local Windows
```
cmd
pscp.exe all.zip training1@cm.com:/home/training1
pscp.exe all.zip training1@dn1.com:/home/training1
```
CM, DN1 Server
```
$ unzip all.zip
$ cd training_materials/devsh/scripts
$ ./setup.sh
```

#### ▪ See how it works. We are going to use it to create some data for ourselves but it won’t work right away. See if you can figure out what needs to be done to make it work.
#### ▪ You will need to add user “training” with password “training” to your MySql installation and Grant the necessary rights
```
$ mysql -u root -p
GRANT ALL ON *.* TO 'training'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'training';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;
```

## 5. Now, attempt some of the exercises that we did during our previous lessons in our new Hadoop cluster.

### - You should practice the following as a minimum
#### ▪ Flume
#### ▪ Sqoop
#### ▪ Hive
#### ▪ Impala
#### ▪ Spark
